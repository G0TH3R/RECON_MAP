<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
This Bash script is designed for reconnaissance purposes and can be used by providing a target VM name and IP address as arguments to create a directory, display a banner, perform port scanning with `nmap`, and generate a "ScratchPad" file for note-taking during the reconnaissance process.
```bash
   sudo ./recon_map <name of Folder> <IP address
```
